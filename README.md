# Purpose
This is a record of my first significant forray down the path of becoming profficent with Swift and SwiftUI.  
Although I have gone down the path of doing these types of tutorials before, not much of the infomation seems to stick because if my intermittent use of the stuff. That said, I am a FullStack Developer (primarily Javascript and C#) by trade, and I have always wanted to become proficient at Swift and SwiftUI.  This project and others to come are my efforts to become fully proficent at developing products for the Apple ecosystem... and who knows ... maybe one day make the switch from Web dev to the world of Apple.

# Landmarks
A SwiftUI Tutorial from Apple to help me gain a more solid understanding of creating applications using the framework and the Swift language
